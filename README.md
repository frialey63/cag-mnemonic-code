Java implementation of the City &amp; Guilds Mnemonic Code

This project is a Java implementation of the City & Guilds Mnemonic Code language which originates from 1964.
The language was the first that I ever encountered as part of my Computer Science A-Level in 1981 at Ashmole School.
My year was the first at the school to include a full class in this new A-Level.
As I recall, most of our usage of this language was in the form of "paper work" exercises.
We did have a facility by which programs could be dispatched to the computer centre at Barnet College for entry on the mainframe and then accessed remotely using the teleterminal at the school.
(This was certainly the way in which I developed code for my later FORTRAN project.)
I have never forgotten the Mnemonic Code language and a summary paper "Appendix B" has resided in my pile of papers as a TODO item for many years.
Note I thought that I had some examples of my work in the language stored in a box in my loft but sadly this does not appear to be the case although the search will continue...
However, with some extra time on my hands now it seemed a good time to resurrect the language in Java, the modern language which has been the foundation of my career in recent years.

For those who are not familiar (and there will be very few who are!) the Mnemonic Code is an assembly language of the most primitive form.
It is an language which appears to have been invented for instruction only, i.e. it was never directly linked with the machine language of any computer hardware.
As previously noted, it originated in 1964 at Elliott Computers where it was implemented on the Elliott 903 computer.  The first reference below describes this implementation and is the primary source for my development of this Java implementation.
The data processing business of Elliott Computers was taken over by ICT (aka ICL) in 1968 and so knowledge of the language transferred to ICL.
At ICL in 1967 it was specified into a form which was suitable for incorporation into the City & Guilds examinations 319 and 320.
This specification is closely related to the original Elliott implementation of 1964.
A bit later in 1968 the specification was revised by ICL also for the City & Guilds examinations 319, see references below.

So by the time I encountered the Mnemonic Code in 1981 it was already a fairly old language.
At some time in the lead-up to 1981 the AEB examination board in England decided to adopt the City & Guilds Mnemonic Code language to support the teaching of their syllabus.
